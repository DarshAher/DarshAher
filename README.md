# 👋 Hello, I’m Darshan Aher

🚀 Data Scientist | 💡 Model Explainability Enthusiast | 🧠 Real-time AI Systems Builder  
I architect machine learning systems that don’t just predict — they **explain**, **scale**, and **work in the wild**.

## 🧭 About Me

I'm a **results-driven Data Scientist** with 4+ years of experience turning unstructured data into actionable intelligence through **machine learning**, **deep learning**, and **edge-deployable real-time systems**.

Whether it's port automation using YOLO + OCR or GPT-powered document intelligence, I believe in building solutions that are both **powerful and interpretable**.

🧩 **I specialize in:**
- End-to-end ML systems: from data ingestion to live deployment
- Real-time computer vision (YOLOv11, PaddleOCR, OpenCV, DeepSORT)
- Explainable ML with SHAP, LIME, Statsmodels
- NLP + LLMs for semantic search and document QA
- Robust backend APIs with FastAPI/Flask & SQL-based logic

## 🔍 Featured Projects

### 🔹 ANPR System @ Chennai Port  
Built a **24/7 live number plate recognition system** using YOLOv11 + PaddleOCR + DeepSORT, deployed on Raspberry Pi, integrating real-time gate/lane info & sync to backend APIs in under 2 seconds.

### 🔹 CNRS: Container Number Recognition  
Developed a **YOLOv11-based detection + OCR engine** to extract container numbers from real-time video feeds with degraded visibility. Scalable & port-ready with 80% faster identification.

### 🔹 Model Explainability in Credit Risk  
Created multiclass models for credit scoring with **threshold tuning**, **cost alignment**, and **SHAP/LIME insights** to support responsible AI and improve financial decisions.

### 🔹 DND Platform: Document Intelligence  
Designed a document & visiting card intelligence system using **EasyOCR + GPT-4 Vision + LLM QA**, with built-in **semantic search** and **entity extraction** from 10,000+ docs.
